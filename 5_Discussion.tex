% Points to discuss -----------

% Research qs were answered


% Some limitations, and opportunities for future work (stuff to do after thesis):
%   1. With metrics - Need to consult more theoretical literature to understand their mathematical properties. This would allow choosing better and more diverse metrics to use and evaluate with the voting method.
%   2. CycleGANs appeared to focus more on FDG features. Would be nice to see through an ablation study whether or not they really use CT features. One way to do this is taking the same trained models, turning off the CT signal in their input and performing inference.
%   3. Turing test

% Other minor stuff to improve on (don't mention in thesis):
%   1. Data loading: More statistically informed TBR normalization
