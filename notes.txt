HX4 dataset name:  "Maastro Lung HX4"

Names for HX4-PET images: 
    - HX4-PET-unreg 
    - HX4-PET-reg
    - HX4-PET-syn


Thesis - Long story short:
    - Using GANs to solve FDG-PET/CT -> HX4-PET translation problem, by modeling HX4 uptake as function of CT features and FDG uptake 
    - Hypothesis: 
        1. GANs can produce realistic HX4-PET-syn images. 
        2. Using the *right* IQA metrics, the overall image quality can be captured effectively. These can be applied also to track model training. Application-specific downstream analysis is also necessary if the goal is clinical adoption.
    - Trying out both paired and unpaired approaches
    - Unpaired CycleGAN not sensible to be applied directly, CycleGAN-balanced created
    - Cleargrasp toy task to prototype and preliminarily compare the GANs -- pix2pix best, balanced improved over naive
    - On real data -- same performance order on image level, balanced training more stable than naive; pix2pix especially sucks on tumor level probably coz reg errors more pronounced at this scale, cyclegans might be promising if sufficient data is given 
    - Conclusion -- 
        1. GANs did produce realistic HX4-PET-syn images.
        2. Using *multiple* IQA metrics of different types, overall image quality can be captured in a more complete manner. They did help quite a bit in tracking model training. Application-specific downstream analysis turned out to be crucial as it highlighted certain weaknesses of the models. 
        3. Unpaired methods more promising because -- no reg related issues, less pressure on clinic and patients for acquiring paired images. 



TODO in thesis:
    - Alexia's suggestions for content structure and introduction
    - Fix tenses
    - Update figures -- text fonts, page fitting
    - Inline URL hyperlinks



TODO work after thesis:
    - Minor stuff to improve on:
        1. Data loading: More statistically informed TBR normalization
